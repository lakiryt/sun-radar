# sunradar

![“Screenshot”](screenshot.png "screenshot")

An [Uebersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) Widget displaying:

- Days past since New Year
- Timezone (set in the preferences pane, not based on the coordinates)
- Coordinates
- Altitude of the sun
- Azimuth of the sun
- Sunrise time
- Sunset time
- Position of the sun plotted onto a radar

How to install:
- Unzip
- Move to the Uebersicht Folder
- That's it! Should be working out of the box.

Preferences to be set by the user (in the *index.coffee* file):
- Language (Currently available in English, Japanese and German)
- Whether you want to be located automatically or not
- Coordinates, if you want them manually set
- Radius of the radar
- Position of the widget (top/left margin)

The small circle marking the sun turns blue when the altitude is negative.
